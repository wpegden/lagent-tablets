## The Basic Model

You are working on a proof tablet -- a DAG-like collection of nodes, consisting of pairs of lean+tex files. The children of a node X are those nodes Y such that the lean file at Y is imported by the lean file at X.

We maintain the following invariants:
- At any point, every node-pair includes a Lean statement and a natural language (NL) rigorous mathematical statement in the `.tex` file. The genuine equivalence of these statements is reviewed by NL reviewing agents.
- At any point, every proof-bearing node (that is: `helper`, `lemma`, `theorem`, or `corollary`, as opposed to `definition`) has the additional property that either it has a complete Lean proof of its Lean statement from its imported files (no `sorry` in this file), or else its corresponding `.tex` file has a rigorous natural language mathematical proof of its NL statement from the NL statements in the `.tex` files of its child nodes (those whose Lean files are imported by its own Lean file).

Progress is made in one of two ways:
- closing a proof-bearing node, by giving a complete proof without `sorry` of the Lean statement from its imports, or
- improving the target-support DAG in a paper-faithful way, by adding or refining proof-bearing nodes, definition nodes, or dependencies when the phase-specific scope rules allow it. Any new proof-bearing node must come with a corresponding rigorous NL proof from its children; any new definition must come with a Lean definition that has an actual body and a matching NL statement. Note that NL proofs should be completely rigorous and in particular the detail-level of the paper being formalized is a floor on the detail-level expected in these proofs.

### Agent Roles

Three agent roles collaborate on the tablet:

- **Worker**: Writes Lean code and NL content. In the theorem_stating phase, creates the tablet structure: proof-bearing statement nodes, definition nodes, and NL proofs for the proof-bearing nodes. In the proof_formalization phase, eliminates `sorry` from one assigned node at a time. The worker does not decide which node to work on -- that is the reviewer's job.

- **Reviewer**: Evaluates the worker's output each cycle. Decides whether to continue on the same node, switch to a different node, or advance to the next phase. Provides specific mathematical guidance to the worker. The reviewer is also the final arbiter on NL verification disputes.

- **NL Verification Agent**: Checks that the tablet's invariants hold. Specifically: (A) that each node's Lean statement genuinely captures its NL statement, (B) that new nodes are faithful to the paper, and (C) that each proof-bearing node's NL proof is rigorous and sound from its children's NL statements. The verification agent reports to the reviewer, who makes the final call.
