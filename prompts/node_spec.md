--- NODE TYPE SPEC ---

Treat `Tablet/{name}.tex` as having one top-level statement environment.

Allowed ordinary node environments:
- `definition`
- `helper`
- `lemma`
- `theorem`
- `corollary`

Allowed `Preamble.tex` environments:
- `definition`
- `proposition`

Use them like this:
- `definition`: a genuine mathematical concept/interface node
- `helper`: a structural auxiliary statement introduced for the tablet's decomposition; it need not match one named paper statement, but it must still be paper-faithful
- `lemma`, `theorem`, `corollary`: paper-anchored statement nodes

Proof-bearing vs non-proof-bearing:
- `helper`, `lemma`, `theorem`, and `corollary` are proof-bearing node types
- proof-bearing nodes should use theorem-like Lean declarations and carry either a complete Lean proof or, while still open, a rigorous NL proof
- `definition` nodes are not proof-bearing; they should use definition-like Lean declarations
- `Preamble.tex` `definition` and `proposition` items are also not proof-bearing

Paper provenance:
- `theorem`, `lemma`, and `corollary` nodes must carry structured paper provenance in tablet state
- provenance requires a paper line range: `start_line`, `end_line`
- provenance may also include `tex_label`
- the cited line range should contain the corresponding paper statement
- when that paper statement carries a `\\label{...}`, include the same label as `tex_label`
- `helper` nodes do not require provenance, but they may optionally record a relevant paper location when that is useful for review context
- `definition` nodes may carry provenance when they really correspond to a paper-anchored definition, but they do not need it in general
- any non-`helper` node that is intended to cover a configured main-result target must carry structured provenance matching that target; for `definition` nodes, this is mandatory whenever they serve as target coverage
- `Preamble.tex` `definition` and `proposition` items may also cite paper locations when that is useful for review, but they are not individual tablet nodes and therefore do not carry node-level structured provenance state

Configured main-result targets:
- `workflow.main_result_targets` identifies the paper items that matter for human review
- one or more non-`helper` nodes may cover a configured target by matching its structured `paper_provenance`
- it is acceptable for a configured target paper item to be covered by multiple non-`helper` nodes, as long as those nodes together completely cover the target item
- a `definition` node may cover a configured target when that target is genuinely definitional
- `helper` nodes may not count as carriers for configured main-result targets
- the tablet should be the support DAG for those configured targets
- all other nodes should exist only insofar as they support at least one configured target

Modeling rules:
- do not use proof-bearing nodes (`helper`, `lemma`, `theorem`, `corollary`) as disguised definitions
- if you are introducing a concept, make it a real `definition` node or document an imported Mathlib concept in `Preamble.tex`
- helper nodes must still reflect the paper's real proof structure; do not introduce gratuitous churn or arbitrary reformulations
- do not keep extra theorem/lemma/corollary nodes, or paper-facing definition nodes, around merely because they appear in the paper; if they are not selected targets, they should only exist when they support a selected target
